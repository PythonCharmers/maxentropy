Usage information
=================

Contains two classes for fitting maximum entropy models and minimum
KL-divergence models (also known as "exponential family" models) subject
to linear constraints on the expectations of arbitrary feature
statistics.  One class, "Model", is for small discrete sample spaces,
using explicit summation. The other, "BigModel", is for sample spaces
that are either continuous (and perhaps high-dimensional) or discrete but
too large to sum over, and uses importance sampling.

The resulting maximum entropy model always has exponential form

..
   p(x) = exp(theta^T f(x)) / Z(theta)

.. math::
   p\\left(x\\right)=\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\theta^{T}f\\left(x\\right)}
                                  {Z\\left(\\theta\\right)}\\right)

with a real parameter vector theta of the same length as the feature
statistic f(x), For more background, see, for example, Cover and
Thomas (1991), *Elements of Information Theory*.

See the file examples/berger_example.py for a simple walk-through of how to use
these routines when the sample space is small enough to be enumerated.

See examples/berger_example_simulated.py for a a similar walk-through using
simulation.
